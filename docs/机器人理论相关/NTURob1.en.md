# NTU Peiqun Lin : Robotics

## Descriptions

- Offered by: National Taiwan University
- Prerequisites: Linear Algebra and Calculus
- Programming Languages: None
- Difficulty: 🌟🌟🌟
- Class Hour: 35 hours

This course ranks among the most-viewed robotics theory courses on Bilibili (possibly the absolute top). It covers fundamental robotics theories such as coordinate transformations, joint representations, and forward/inverse kinematics, divided into kinematics and dynamics sections. It serves as an excellent introductory course for those researching robotic systems rather than pure AI, with the instructor delivering exceptionally clear and accessible explanations.
