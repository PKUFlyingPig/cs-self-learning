- Class Hour: 100 hours

This is the last course in Berkeley's CS61 series, which dives into the internal of computer architecture and will make you understand how the C language is translated into RISC-V assembly language and executed on the CPU. Unlike [Nand2Tetris](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/cs-self-learning/blob/master/docs/%E4%BD%93%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84/N2T.md), this course is much more difficult and more in-depth, covering pipelining, cache, virtual memory, and concurrency-related content.

The projects are very innovative and interesting. Project1 is a warmup assignment in C. In 2020Fall, you will implement the famous *Game of Life*. Project2 requires you to write a fully-connected neural network in RISC-V assembly to classify handwritten digits in MNIST dataset, which is a great exercise to write assembly code. In Project3, you will use Logisim, a digital circuit simulation software, to build a two-stage pipeline CPU from scratch and run RISC-V assembly code on it. In Project4 you will implement a toy version of Numpy, using OpenMP, SIMD, and other techniques to speed up matrix operations.

In a word, this is the best computer architecture course I have ever taken.
