This course will begin with the basics of the C programming language and digital circuit fundamentals, guiding you step-by-step to first implement a RISC-V instruction set simulator named NEMU that can run Super Mario, and then assist you in completing your processor chip design on this simulator, ultimately running the RT-Thread or even a Linux system on your custom-designed CPU.

Regardless of which school or major you come from, simply by registering on the official website, you can join this project for free; and if you are an undergraduate student who meets the project team's requirements for tape-out metrics, the team will provide free tape-out services for you, allowing you to graduate with a chip designed by yourself!
