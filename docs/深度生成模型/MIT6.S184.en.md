This course is an introductory diffusion model course offered during MIT's IAP term by MIT CSAIL. Taught by MIT students Peter Holderrieth and Ezra Erives, the course provides a clear and accessible explanation of the mathematical foundations of diffusion and flow-matching models from the perspective of differential equations. It also includes hands-on labs where students build diffusion models from scratch, concluding with lectures on applications in cutting-edge areas such as molecular design and robotics.

The accompanying lecture notes are exceptionally well-written and highly recommended for in-depth reading.
