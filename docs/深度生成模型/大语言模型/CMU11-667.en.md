This graduate-level course provides a comprehensive overview of methods and applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering a wide range of topics from core architectures to cutting-edge techniques. Course content includes:

1. **Foundations**: Neural network architectures for language modeling, training procedures, inference, and evaluation metrics.  
2. **Advanced Topics**: Model interpretability, alignment methods, emergent capabilities, and applications in both textual and non-textual domains.  
3. **System & Optimization Techniques**: Large-scale pretraining strategies, deployment optimization, and efficient training/inference methods.  
4. **Ethics & Safety**: Addressing model bias, adversarial attacks, and legal/regulatory concerns.

The course blends lectures, readings, quizzes, interactive exercises, assignments, and a final project to offer students a deep and practical understanding of LLMs, preparing them for both research and real-world system development.

**Self-Study Tips**:

- Thoroughly read all assigned papers and materials before each class.  
- Become proficient with PyTorch and implement core models and algorithms by hand.  
- Complete the assignments diligently to build practical skills and reinforce theoretical understanding.
