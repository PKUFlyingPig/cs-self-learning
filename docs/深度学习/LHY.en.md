Professor Hung-yi Lee, a professor at National Taiwan University, is known for his humorous and engaging teaching style. He often incorporates fun elements like PokÃ©mon into his slides, making the learning experience enjoyable.

Although labeled as a machine learning course, the breadth of topics covered is impressive. The course includes a total of 15 labs covering Regression, Classification, CNN, Self-Attention, Transformer, GAN, BERT, Anomaly Detection, Explainable AI, Attack, Adaptation, RL, Compression, Life-Long Learning, and Meta Learning. This wide coverage allows students to gain insights into various domains of deep learning, helping them choose areas for further in-depth study.

Don't be overly concerned about the difficulty of the assignments. All assignments come with example code from teaching assistants, guiding students through data processing, model building, and more. Students are required to make modifications based on the provided code. This presents an excellent opportunity to learn from high-quality code, and the assignments serve as valuable resources for those looking to breeze through course projects.

The 2025 version of the course has undergone a reform of the course content, focusing more on RAG, AI Agent, LLM all sorts of fancier content; it differs greatly from the 2023 version and previous versions
