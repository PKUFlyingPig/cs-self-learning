This course has been voted the most popular public course by Harvard students for many years. Professor Malan is very passionate in class. I still remember the scene where he tears up the Yellow pages to explain the dichotomy method. Since this is a university-wide public course, the contents are pretty friendly to beginners and even if you already have some programming experience, all the programming assignments are quite exciting and worth a try.
