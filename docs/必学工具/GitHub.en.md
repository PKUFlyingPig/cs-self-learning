## What is GitHub

Functionally, GitHub is an online platform for hosting code. You can host your local Git repositories on GitHub for collaborative development and maintained by a group. However, GitHub's significance has evolved far beyond that. It has become a very active and resource-rich open-source community. Developers from all over the world share a wide variety of open-source software on GitHub. From industrial-grade deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow to practical scripts consisting of just a few lines of code, GitHub offers hardcore knowledge sharing, beginner-friendly tutorials, and even many technical books are open-sourced here (like the one you're reading now). Browsing GitHub has become a part of my daily life.

On GitHub, stars are the ultimate affirmation for a project. If you find this book useful, you are welcome to enter the repository's homepage via the link in the upper right corner and give your precious star✨.

## How to Use GitHub

If you have never created your own remote repository on GitHub or cloned someone else's code, I suggest you start your open-source journey with [GitHub's official tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

If you want to keep up with some interesting open-source projects on GitHub, I highly recommend the [HelloGitHub](https://hellogithub.com/) website. It regularly features GitHub's recently trending or very interesting open-source projects, giving you the opportunity to access various quality resources firsthand.

I believe GitHub's success is due to the "one for all, all for one" spirit of open source and the joy of sharing knowledge. If you also want to become the next revered open-source giant or the author of a project with tens of thousands of stars, then transform your ideas that spark during development into code and showcase them on GitHub.

However, it's important to note that the open-source community is not lawless. Many open-source softwares are not meant for arbitrary copying, distribution, or even sale. Understanding various [open-source licenses](https://www.runoob.com/w3cnote/open-source-license.html) and complying with them is not only a legal requirement but also the responsibility of every member of the open-source community.
