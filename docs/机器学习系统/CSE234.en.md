This course is focused on designing a wholistic LLM System class as an introduction to design efficient systems for LLM. 

The class into three parts, covering the following topics.

1. Basics: deep learning, autodiff, CUDA programming, ML hardware
2. ML systems and optimizations: Dataflow graph systems, ML compilation, memory and graph optimization, ML parallelism, auto-parallelization
3. LLM systems: LLM training, data curation, inference and serving, attention optimization, scaling law, RAG, LLM agents
