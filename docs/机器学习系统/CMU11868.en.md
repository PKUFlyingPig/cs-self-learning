# CMU 11868: Large Language Model System

## Course Overview

- University: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
- Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of deep learning
- Programming Language: Python, CUDA
- Difficulty: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Class Hour: 60 hours

In recent years, the progress of artificial intelligence has benefited greatly from the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and other generative methods. These models are usually huge in scale (e.g., GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters), so it is crucial to develop scalable LLM Systems.
In this course, students will learn the core skills of designing LLMs at the system level.
One of the major differences between this course and other similar courses is that there are quite a few GPU acceleration technologies involved in this course. The course will introduce the famous [FlashAttention](https://llmsystem.github.io/llmsystem2024spring/assets/files/Group-FlashAttention-0b70d553037a7729dd2a9af5e23d8b3e.pdf), and the experiments also require you to implement some operators to accelerate training.
Overall, the course is very suitable for students who are interested in the system design of large language models.

This course requires you to have a certain amount of preparation for deep learning and is not suitable for complete beginners. You can see the prerequisites in the [FAQ](https://llmsystem.github.io/llmsystem2024spring/docs/FAQ).
The experiments are generally challenging, and the main contents are as follows:

1. Assignment1: Automatic differentiation framework + handwritten CUDA operator + basic neural network construction
2. Assignmant2: GPT2 model construction
3. Assignment3: Optimize model training speed by optimizing Softmax and LayerNorm operators written in CUDA
4. Assignment4: Distributed model training, which may not be easy to configure the environment for self-study

Like many other high-quality courses, the slides and assignments of this course are open-source, with quite detailed local test code, suitable for self-study.
